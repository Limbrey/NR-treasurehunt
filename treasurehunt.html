                  <p>The New Relic Treasure Hunt is a fun way of experiencing the New Relic platform - in the context of a demo environment where some known issues are happening.  As a practitioner in the world of modern Digital development and operation, you will face many of these challenges in your own world.  The Treasure Hunt will guide you through several scenarios where observability and insight may lead you to better outcomes.  Happy hunting!</p>

                  <p>After a long voyage at sea - you’re settling down for a tot of rum and hard-tack, only to be interrupted by a text indicating your critical pirate WebPortal is having an issue. What do you do next? For most folks without an APM solution, the story is archaic: log into machines, sift through large log files, and inevitably guess at what is occurring. New Relic makes this story a non-issue by allowing you to quickly hone in on the specific cause of any issue quickly and within context.</p>

                  <p>Applications are fundamentally different then they were ten years ago (even five years ago).  You are no longer dealing with a single, complex application on a handful of hosts, but are generally facing a series of light-weight applications spread across many hosts.  This means that debugging is often a cross-application exercise.  The following demo will show how bad code deployed to a backend service can impact user-experience and will show how easy it is to notice and understand with New Relic APM.</p>

The point is that this is what an exception looks like to a customer.  Someone who wanted to give money for your product was unable to accomplish that and is likely frustrated.

                          <p>There is a very clear story of what is happening on the Plan service.  A deployment marker goes out that indicates a developer is trying to optimize database queries and immediately after a spike in the response time can be seen.  Someone has released bad code.  About ten minutes later a second deployment marker goes out that is meant to be a hotfix (a live fix in production) to patch that issue, and while it does appear the response time improved, it still is much worse than before.  Finally a last deployment marker goes out that shows them rolling everything back.  This gives a clear depiction to 'what' happened, but its still important to know 'how' it happened at a technical level.

                          <p>Clicking into the Transaction view, we can see the 'GetPlans' API is experiencing the slowdowns.  Drilling in further we can see that a call to the database seems to be issued hundreds of times for each time the API is called.  This is a common technical problem known as an "N+1".  Think about going to the grocery story, buying one item, driving home, putting it away and then driving back to the grocery story to grab another item as opposed to just grabbing everything at once.  Clicking into the Database tab under the transaction you can show the customer the exact query that was issued against the database which includes an 'id = ?' field that indicates that they are requesting items one at a time by their ID.  You can also show that the two deploys have two different behaviors.  The first is the N+1 that we just discussed, but the second solves the N+1 and instead introduces a slow stored procedure.

                  <p>If you order a item from Amazon and it arrives at your house broken or late; do you really care why?  If it was the fault of the manufacturer, the distributor or the delivery person it is equally as annoying.  The same logic applies to a website.  If a customer navigates to a page and it doesn't work or takes too long, they are not interested in the technical reasons why.  Despite this fact, many customers only monitor their backend services and ignore other the other critical tiers (frontend and infrastructure) despite those areas being just as prone to degrade user experience.  The following demo will emphasize the importance of Browser and Infrastructure in avoiding blindspots in your monitoring story.</p>

                  <p>The previous demos have focused on knowing when something has gone wrong, but that means that it has already gone wrong and your customers are feeling the pain; that is, it is retroactive monitoring.  Wouldn't it be better if you knew about your issues before or immediately after customers were impacted by them?  The following demo shows how you can use New Relic Synthetics to proactively monitor your systems with a 'canary' approach as well as how New Relic Alerts can be used to ensure you're notified as soon as things go awry.</p>

The Bug Hunt

Which transaction is suffering?  [/browse/plans.jsp | /browse/phone.jsp | /browse/phones.jsp | /index.jsp | /browse/plan.jsp]
Looking within a transaction trace - can you identify which segment is causing the issue?
What caused the issue?  [ gparker deployed revision Optimizing Database Query ]
How did the issue get resolved [gparker deployed revision Rolling Back Query Changes]



Special Delivery
After getting marooned on a desert island for days - and running out of supplies - your pirate friends place an emergency online delivery on your platform for a new barbeque.  The trouble really starts when they start fighting each other because the online shopping experience is terrible on their pillaged smartphones.  What’s going wrong with the user experience in the WebPortal?

What’s the most common cause of error?  [Error: Times out loading source ./js/couponSpecial.js]
What part of the world is suffering the most with performance?


Getting ahead of the curve
A good pirate is always planning ahead - and how better to do that than with Synthetics checks?  A synthetic check is emulating real user activity on your webpage or API - and reporting the results.  In this treasure hunt - we want you to find the slowest of the APIs - and then to use Insights to create a dashboard showing where the API performance can be improved.

In Synthetics - find one of the slowest API invocations and highlight where the performance problem is.  
Using the SyntheticRequest namespace in Insights - answer the following questions
What’s the 95th percentile of duration for the http://coretron.telco.nrdemo-partner.com:80 API?	[870ms]
Using the FACET qualifier - what is the URL with the highest average duration?  [http://webportal.telco.nrdemo-partner.com/browse/phones/67424431]



Tying everything together
Understanding metrics and events is important - but when you’re planning any sort of refactoring or re-architecting to more ephemeral architectures - understanding the dependencies and relationships is even more fundamental.  Fortunately - New Relic One takes a fresh view.  As the industry’s first entity-centric observability platform - we can easily find a way of navigating through the relationships - whether infrastructure, application, external service - or anything else.

Looking at the Inventory Service.  How many hosts does this service depend on?
What type of database is being used?
What tables are being used by the service?
